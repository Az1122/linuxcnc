TODO for the joints_axes branch

* clean up joints/axes throughout the whole code (lots of parts already done)
* define a unified jogging way (both for joints and axes)
* implement joint-limits for carthesian moves (requires simulating the speed in userspace)
* update configs
(and many other probably..)

THINGS THAT ARE DESIRABLE FOR THE NEXT MAJOR RELEASE (EMC-2.3)

TODO     sort out axis/joints issues:
	    * limits need to be imposed on joints (tricky with kins)
	    * ini changes 
	    * clean out code (on all different levels, when joints are involved, call them joints..)

TODO	 Jeff: make gcode/main.lyx docs match implementation for IOs

TODO     Convert all hardware drivers to use canonical homing, 

Fixes in HAL modules:
TODO     canonical interfaces and naming conventions

TODO     hal_m5i20 driver update
         -conform to canonical interfaces
         -enable loading of different configs
              - should be possible to load a different config on separate 
                cards if many cards are present
              - make the PWM rate a HAL parameter 
                 (currently it's specified when loading the driver)
         -enable autodetection of configs
              - 33 or 100 MHz PWM clock (affects timing calculations)
              - 4 or 8-axis config (how many ENCs and DACs, how much I/O)
         -make a version that works with pico-systems amps
           (50kHz PWM and 'handshake' at amp bootup)
         -enable writing the CCR register (is this needed?)

TODO	jmkasunich:
	Remove the abandoned mesa-5i2x driver and firmware trees.
	The new hostmot2 system actually works (and is far better).
	The the files will remain in CVS history for reference.
